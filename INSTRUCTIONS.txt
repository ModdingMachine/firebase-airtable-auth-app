FIREBASE AIRTABLE AUTH APP - LOCAL RUN INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

BEFORE YOU RUN THE APP, YOU MUST SET UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES!

This app requires Firebase and Airtable credentials to work.
Without them, the app will not function.

QUICK SETUP (Follow in order):
==============================

1. SET UP AIRTABLE (5 min)
   - Create a free account at https://airtable.com
   - Create a base with a "Users" table
   - Add fields: uid, email, displayName, phone, role, updatedAt
   - Get your Base ID and Personal Access Token
   - See SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions

2. SET UP FIREBASE (5 min)
   - Create a project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Enable Email/Password and Google authentication
   - Get your Web SDK config
   - Create a service account JSON
   - See SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions

3. CREATE ENVIRONMENT FILES (2 min)
   
   A) Create server/.env with:
      - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
      - AIRTABLE_API_KEY, AIRTABLE_BASE_ID, AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME
   
   B) Create client/.env with:
      - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, etc.
      - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   
   See .env.example files in both directories for templates!

4. RUN THE APP (1 min)
   
   From the project root directory:
   
   npm run dev
   
   This will start both the server (port 5000) and client (port 5173)
   The browser will open automatically at http://localhost:5173

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If you see "No response from server":
- Make sure you created the server/.env file
- Check that the server is running on port 5000

If authentication fails:
- Verify your Firebase credentials in client/.env
- Make sure Email/Password auth is enabled in Firebase Console

If Airtable errors occur:
- Check your API key and Base ID in server/.env
- Verify the table is named exactly "Users"
